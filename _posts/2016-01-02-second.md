#### Unleash the Power of Tables
We all love spreadsheets and can't get enough of them. From doing our personal finances over [programming video games](http://mashable.com/2014/08/27/microsoft-excel-games/#fuIwZM00xuqL) to data analysis. [Economists have long known about the inherent power of *Microsoft Excel*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-18/faq-reinhart-rogoff-and-the-excel-error-that-changed-history). But bioinformatics has been waiting for it's great spreadsheet breakthrough.

While there are [BioPerl](http://bioperl.org/), [Biopython](http://biopython.org/), [BioRuby](http://bioruby.org/) et al., there just was no *Bio\** package for our favorite spreadsheet tool, *Excel*.

This changes now.
