#### Analyse Next-Generation-Sequencing Data
Preprocessing your Next Generation Sequencing reads was possible in *Excel* before, but it was a pain. With *BioExcel* you can now adapter-trim, clip and deduplicate your sequences, right in *Excel*. And of course, *Short Read Mapping* and *de novo assembly* are part of the package too. Keep your eyes open for the next mapping and assembly benchmarks!
