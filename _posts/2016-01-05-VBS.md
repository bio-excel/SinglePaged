#### Unleash Visual Basic
`Visual Basic for Applications` is one of the worlds most popular programming languages. And you can use it right away from *Excel*. With *BioExcel* it is easy to adapt and extend the existing solutions. In the span of a few minutes you can write your own functions. And give them back to the community, thanks to our integration with [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/lolnope)!
