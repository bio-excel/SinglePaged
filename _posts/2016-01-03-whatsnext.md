#### Designed with Big Data in Mind
We have all done our fair share of tests for differential gene expression or functional enrichments in beloved *Excel*, after we spent hours of desperately trying to install [Bioconductor packages](https://www.bioconductor.org/). But working with big data on the other hand was so far limited to these pesky command line utilities. *BioExcel* changes this, and comes with support not only for `*.fasta`, but also `*.fastq` and `*.vcf` files.
