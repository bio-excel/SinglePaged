#### Dates, meet Genes
You have probably heard about the annoying short-coming of *Excel* when it comes to [gene names that are misinterpreted as dates](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7). Most annoying: the conversation is a one-way street.

With *BioExcel* this is finally no longer true. From now on `MARCH1` will not only be converted to `1-Mar`, but you can also just enter your favorite gene names as dates. *BioExcel* automatically recognizes that `2017-3-1` was meant to be `MARCH1` and will give you the correct gene name.
